The concept of chance operations is one that I had been relatively unfamiliar with;however, as I did some research, I felt particularly interested in the work of artist, John Cage. Because I play the piano and love music, I was intrigued by Cage’s work "Music of Changes." Throughout 1951, Cage tossed coins to determine the pitch, dynamics, and duration for the song. While other “chance artists” were more erratic in their randomness, Cage’s methods were more calculated in nature. Personally, I really love the fact that a human action, the flipping of a coin, essentially determined the sound produced by this song. This sort of interaction with art makes the emotional response even more compelling in my opinion. Below is a link to the song.

While Cage strived to completely remove himself from the decision-making process in creating his pieces, Pollock aimed to create paintings that were an intentional expression of his manic inner ego. For instance, his painting Number 32, 1950 is rooted in randomness, a reflection of his emotional turmoil. I find that these different dimensions of randomness are very compelling. I anticipate my own piece leaning more towards the style of Cage, since even when random I tend to gravitate towards uniformity. However, the complete freedom of Pollock is quite enticing and is definitely an artistic technique I would like to attempt in the future.
